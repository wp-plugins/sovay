Sovay secures your identity keeping your private data private, secures your site, lets you choose your login style and access your sites with 1 login.

== Description ==  
####Secure Yourself.  Secure Your Sites.

Get control of your identity now.  Get your SovayID.  Every time you create an account with a username and password, you create a new web identity.  That is how you ended up with 25 identities (and 25 passwords).  With Sovay, you get one secure identity.  Your logins are secure, your private data is private and you can use your SovayID to access all of your WordPress sites.

Once you have secured yourself, secure your site.  Install the Sovay plugin and start using your SovayID.  It is that simple!  In case you did not know, your username and password are sent in plain text during the default WordPress login; hackers love plain text.  Using your SovayID, your login data is always sent over secure communications.  

Activate Sovay on all of your WordPress sites; the plugin is free.  Then login once with your secure SovayID, and you will have access to all of your WordPress sites with no further authentication hassels.  

Choose your login for each site.  If you want to login with One Time Passcode for some sites, great!  If you want to use your voice or face for other sites, even better!  But remember, it is silly to protect your passwords with a password.  

**_Your security, your site, your choice!_**

####Secure your site in minutes.  
Three easy steps:

#####Secure Your Identity
