Sovay secures your identity and your WordPress site logins. Authenticate once and securely access all your sites &#8212; without password hassles.

== Description ==  
####WordPress Logins Aren't Secure

WordPress sends usernames and passwords in plain text over the Internet, where they are intercepted and stolen by hackers. It’s no surprise that 30,000 WordPress sites are compromised daily, most commonly via stolen passwords. 

Once hackers break into a WordPress site, they steal user identities, misappropriate information, send spam, distribute malware, host phishing pages and redirect users to other sites &#8212; long before site owners are even aware that their site has been hacked.

To stop hackers from taking over your WordPress sites, use Sovay for WordPress to secure your personal identity and your site logins.
